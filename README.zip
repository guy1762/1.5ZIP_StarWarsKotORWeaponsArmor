# 1.5ZIP_StarWarsKotORWeaponsArmor
This is a .zip pack for Star Wars KotOR Weapons &amp; Armor for Rimworld 1.5. Mod description here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2938932438 

because github has an annoying 25mb upload limit, I've had to split KotOR Core and Weapons & Armor into multiple parts since the apparel textures and sounds take up a lot of space. simply unzip and merge the files together in their respective mod root folders.
